A console command-base project Demonstrating the concepts of matrices used in mathematics that signifies the implementation of multi-dimensional Array Data Structure through Java.
Program consists of implementing loops, arrays, dimensional algorithms and simple representation of one of the most important concept used in computer mathematics that is called Matrix.

Including all the operational features like :
1) Arithimatic operations on Matrices : Add, Subtract, Multiplication, Division.
2) Transpose of Matrix (Exceptional step to form inverse).
3) Inverse of the matrix.
